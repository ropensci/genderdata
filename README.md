This package contains several datasets of use for historians and social scientists studying gender. These data sets were compiled in this package for use with the [gender](https://github.com/ropensci/gender) package for predicting gender from first names.

The raw data sets used in this package are available here:

-   [Mark Kantrowitz's name corpus](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/ai-repository/ai/areas/nlp/corpora/names/0.html)
-   [Social Security Administration's baby names by year (and by state and territories)](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html)
-   [IPUMS Census data](https://usa.ipums.org/)
-   [North Atlantic Population Project](https://www.nappdata.org/napp/)
